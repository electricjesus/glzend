            When GL Nederland BV took over the silver factory of the Dutch "Royal van Kempen en Begeer" in 1984, she also took over 33 
            professional Dutch craftsman, a large amount of machines and also a container filled with carton boxes.
        </p>
        <p class="factory">
            The owner of GL wanted to throw away all the boxes. Fortunately that did not happen because the content of the boxes consisted 
            of more than 30.000 original, well conserved malls. All malls were designed in the period of approximately 1825 up to the end of 1930. 
        </p>
        <p class="factory">
            Since then, GL is producing partly replica's of the antique models from the original malls and partly totally new jewellery by combining 
            several components.
        </p>
        <p class="factory">
            We are very proud that we are still producing in our own factory in Holland. So, if you want to have a look into our Dutch based 
            factory, please click on the movie.
